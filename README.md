# CR0NEX

> *Breach the unreachable. Silence the signal.*

**CR0NEX** is a cinematic, terminal-based "Hollywood hacker simulator" designed for fun, demos, intros, or just to make you feel like youâ€™re breaking into the Pentagon â€” the *realistic* way.

It features a Matrix-style ASCII waterfall, dramatic fade-ins, and elite cyber-ops aesthetic.
